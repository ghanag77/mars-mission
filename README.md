Assignment
A human mission to MARS is not very far, considering the technological advances humans have
achieved in 21st century. Many scientists from across the globe are collectively working to
shortlist candidates who are fit for such travel. Nasa in collaboration with global space agencies
like ESA and ISRO have launched a website for everyone to apply. Shortlisted candidates will go
through extensive training of 2 years. However contrary to expectations, millions have applied
and people involved in shortlisting process are finding it difficult to process such large
information and shortlist candidates.
Fortunately, they have you.
Your task is to design a service which will take such large data as input and process it and
provide results based on filter that they apply.
